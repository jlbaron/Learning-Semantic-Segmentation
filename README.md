# Learning-Semantic-Segmentation
I want to get hands-on experience with image segmentation.


Data: LabPicsChemistry
Model: U-NET

<h1> Progress </h1>
<p> Combed through dataset and learned how to access semantic maps. Working on dataloader code next. Dataloader will only include a specific list of categories to keep things orderly and easy to run on my laptop. Next steps are to debug the UNET and complete the main.ipynb functions</p>
