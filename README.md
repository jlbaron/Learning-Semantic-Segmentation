# Learning-Semantic-Segmentation
I want to get hands-on experience with image segmentation.


Data: LabPicsChemistry
Model: U-NET

<h1> Progress </h1>
<p> Combed through dataset and learned how to access semantic maps. Completed dataloader, unet, and training loop. Began training and tuning network hyperparameters. Next steps are per pixel accuracy and testing different loss functions </p>
